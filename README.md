![Screenshot](https://github.com/leeprovoost/my-vim-setup/raw/master/screenshot.png)

This is my own VIM setup, using Solarized Dark scheme and vim-airline statusline configuration.

This assumes that you have set up iTerm2 with Powerline fonts and Solarized colour scheme as desribed [here](https://github.com/leeprovoost/my-oh-my-zsh).

1. Install NeoBundle (Vim package manager): `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim/master/bin/install.sh | sh`
2. Copy (or add) contents of file vimrc to your ~/.vimrc settings file
3. Download vim-colors-solarized: `git clone https://github.com/altercation/vim-colors-solarized`
4. Copy the colour file: `cp colors/solarized.vim ~/.vim/colors/`
5. Launch vim, it will ask you to install packages
